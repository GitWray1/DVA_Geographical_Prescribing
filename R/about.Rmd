### How to use this dashboard

This prototype dashboard has been populated with data on the prescribing of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in England. There are two tabs available for users to explore this data:

The **Prescribing map** tab allows users to select their medicine, variable, health area and date range of interest. As the user modifies these inputs the map will dynamically update to show the the prescribing for the selected medicine and variable aggregated across the date range. 

The line chart to the right shows the average prescribing across the selected health areas along with 95% confidence intervals (e.g. the average items across all 106 CCGs). The bar chart beneath allows comparison of all individual areas compared to the national median.

A user may click on an individual area of the map to highlight this area on the line and bar charts, allowing comparison to national trends.

All charts are interactive and will show individual values when hovered over. Charts can also be downloaded via the hover ribbon in the top right of each chart. 

The **Data** tab allows users to explore the underlying data by adding their own filters. Users may download the full or filtered dataset. 

### Data sources

**Prescribing and population data** was requested from the [OpenPrescribing API][2], which provides a search interface for the [English Prescribing Dataset][3], published by the NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA).

**BNF codes and names** are taken from the NHSBSA [Information Services Portal][4].

**CCG to STP and region mapping** information is taken from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) [Open Geography Portal][5].

**CCG, STP and regional boundaries** are taken from the ONS [Open Geography Portal][5].

All data is used under the terms of the Open Government Licence


### Data definitions 

The definitions below were taken directly from [OpenPrescribing.net][6]. For more information we recommend reading the [OpenPrescribing FAQs][1].

**Items** shows the number of times a medicine has been prescribed. It says nothing about how much of it has been prescribed (for that see quantity) as some presciptions will be for many weeksâ€™ worth of treatment while others will be much smaller.

**Quantity** is the total amount of a medicine that has been prescribed, but the units used depend on the particular form the medicine is in:

- Where the formulation is tablet, capsule, ampoule, vial etc the quantity will be the number of tablets, capsules, ampoules, vials etc

- Where the formulation is a liquid the quantity will be the number of millilitres

- Where the formulation is a solid form (eg. cream, gel, ointment) the quantity will be the number of grams

- Where the formulation is inhalers the quantity is usually the number of inhalers (but there are occasionally inconsistencies here so exercise caution when analysing this data)

Care must be taken when adding together quantities. Obviously quantities cannot be added across units. But even within a given unit it may not make sense to add together quantities of different preparations with different strengths and formulations.

**Actual cost** is the estimated cost to the NHS of supplying a medicine. The Drug Tariff and other price lists specify a Net Ingredient Cost (NIC) for a drug, but pharmacists usually receive a discount on this price. Additionally they receive a "container allowance" each time they dispense a prescription. The actual cost is estimated from the net ingredient cost by subtracting the average percentage discount received by pharmacists in the previous month and adding in the cost of the container allowance.
